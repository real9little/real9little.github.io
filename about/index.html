          <h1 id="A-Short-Intro"><a href="#A-Short-Intro" class="headerlink" title="A Short Intro"></a>A Short Intro</h1><p>My research focuses on developing perception algorithms for robotics, such as visual SLAM, visual inertia odometry, multi-modal sensor fusion with GPS&#x2F;odometer and etc,. In the recent years after graduation, I also developed coverage planning algorithms on both robotic arms and mobile platforms for industrial application. Except from developing softwares and algorithms, I enjoy building different kinds of hardware platforms for toy robotic applications during my part-time. I married with Dr. Liye Sun who is also doing research work in the field of robotics and computer vision and have a 3-years old cute baby girl.</p>
<h1 id="Education-Background"><a href="#Education-Background" class="headerlink" title="Education Background"></a>Education Background</h1><p>I spent most of my childhood time in Lu’an, Anhui with nothing in particular. When I was at the age of thirteen, I was fortunate enough to visit Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center located on the Gobi Desert. This later became the most important motivation when I selected astraunautics as the major of the my master study. Till today, I still believe that rocket science especially Mars rovers such as Curiosity is one the most complicated and advanced robotic system on this planet. I enjoyed reading science fictions magazines during my young age and Science Fiction World is my favorite. </p>
<p>I completed my bachelor degree at Northwestern Polytechnical University, located in Xi’an Shaanxi from 2006 to 2010. I was able to learn different subjects as a student at Honor College (formly known as Education Experimental School), from electronic engineering to automation, from math to computer science. I also met my wife during the three beautiful years at Honor Colledge. I moved School of Astraunautics in the last year of my bachelor work and completed my Master degree there. I was working on state estimation of cooperative or even hostile spacecrafts using computer vision and orbital mechanics. Since then, I was getting to know visual SLAM, multiple view geometry and other tools which were used in the next 10 years till now. I have earned multiple awards during my master work and got tuition waiver throughout my two and a half years of master study.</p>
<p>From the December of 2012, I started my Ph.D. work at University of Technolody, Sydney, supervised by Prof. Gamini Dissanayake. Spending fours years pursuing a Ph.D degree is nothing difficult and painful for me, oppositely, fours years at Center for Autonomous System is the most impressive and memberable experience during my whole life. I have the opportunity to work with Prof. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DMsPWz0AAAAJ&hl=en">Shoudong Huang</a>, Prof. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ywxel7QAAAAJ&hl=en">Dikai Liu</a>, Dr. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://profiles.uts.edu.au/Ravindra.Ranasinghe/about">Ravindra Ranasinghe</a> and Dr. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://profiles.uts.edu.au/Liang.Zhao">Liang Zhao</a>, and met so many good friends such as Dr. Teng Zhang, Dr. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.mit.edu/~mrrobot/">Kasra Khosoussi</a>, Dr. Lakshitha (Laki) Dantanarayana, DR. Raphael Falque and on and on. My wife also did her Ph.D work with me at the same lab. I completed my Ph.D work at the Decemeber of 2016 and received my Ph.D. degree in 2017. </p>
